## Build Tool
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/): v2.12.0

Parcel is a fast, zero-configuration web application bundler that supports various file types out of the box, making it easy to set up and use for building React applications. It provides features such as hot module replacement, code splitting, and automatic asset optimization, enhancing the development experience and improving build performance.

## Stack
- [React](https://react.dev/): v18.3.1

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that promotes code reusability and simplifies the development of interactive and dynamic web applications. React's virtual DOM and efficient rendering engine contribute to its high performance. The combination of React and Parcel offers a powerful and efficient toolset for developing the client-side of moonflix, ensuring a responsive user experience.
